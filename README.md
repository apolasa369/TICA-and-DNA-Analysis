# TICA-and-DNA-Analysis

Simple Python library for MD trajectory analysis, which can be used on both high-performance computing systems and workstations. 
This library includes scripts for
# Principal component analysis (PCA),
Principal component analysis should be carried out (PCA). PCA captures degrees of freedom that have the most variation in their values.

# Time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA),
This procedure does Independent Component Analysis (ICA) using a time-structured approach (tICA).
In particular, tICA captures degrees of freedom that are very relevant in the sense that their movements are extremely slow.

# Dynamic network analysis (DNA)
Â Dynamical Network Analysis, a technique is used that is based on the correlation of the movement of representative atoms , such as the alpha-carbons of amino acid residues, in a network. This is used to assess whether or not a connection exists between distinct atoms or molecules in a system and the strength with which that link exists.
python ploting scripts for respective analysis are also provided.
